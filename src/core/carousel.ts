// Pure conversions between a carousel's inline `PageComposition` records and the
// full `Project` the single-composition editor understands. A page is a FULL
// composition (video OR image): the carousel controller edits one page at a time
// by PROJECTING it into a transient Project (`pageToProject`) and committing
// edits back (`projectToPage`), carrying the page's whole timeline
// (video/audio/duration/loop/markers) so a video page's timeline works. Every
// page shares the carousel's own `canvas_width`/`canvas_height` — changeable
// like any video, never a locked aspect. `blankCarousel` mints a fresh carousel
// morpha; `wrapAsCarousel` turns a single-page video morpha into a carousel
// whose page 1 is its current top-level composition. No I/O, no React, no
// zustand, no DOM.

// Build a full Project from one carousel page. The parent carousel's
// `project_id` flows through so uploaded assets resolve to the ONE carousel
// bucket; its `org_id` flows through too so the editor scopes the TopNav project
// picker to the carousel's workspace — without it a workspace carousel's
// projection looks personal, the picker can't find the project in the (personal)
// summaries, and the header label falls back to "Untitled". `org_id` is
// display-only here (the projection is never persisted — carousel saves go
// through the controller's own record; `projectToPage` never reads it back), so
// carrying it can't corrupt a page. The parent's project-level context —
// `custom_fonts`, `collection`, `embed_origins` — flows through too so it
// keeps working while a page is open; unlike `org_id` the user can MUTATE
// those three on the projection, and the controller merges them back onto the
// record's top level on commit (`projectToPage` itself stays a pure page-field
// whitelist). Canvas dims come from the parent's own
// `canvas_width`/`canvas_height`; the page's whole composition
// (video/audio/duration/start/loop/markers) is carried through so its timeline
// plays. Parsed through `projectSchema` so every other field lands at its
// default and the shape is guaranteed valid.

// Three responsibilities:
//   1. The page slot named by `pageId` takes `projectToPage(edited)`. An
//      unknown `pageId` (the projected page was deleted) returns `record`
//      unchanged — nothing to commit.

//      onto the RECORD's top level (`projectToPage` is a pure page-field
//      whitelist, so page slots never grow project-level fields).
//   3. Dims differing between `edited` and `record` mean the composition was
//      RESIZED while this page was projected: the resize already reflowed the
//      projection (its layers are captured by the fold in 1), but the record's
//      dims and every OTHER page were untouched. Reflow each other page through
//      the same `reflowComposition` the resize used — project it at the
//      record's still-old dims, scale, fold back — and stamp the record's dims
//      LAST so the branch is idempotent: the next commit sees matching dims and
//      skips, so pages reflow exactly once per resize.
